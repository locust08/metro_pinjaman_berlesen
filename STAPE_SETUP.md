# GTM and GA4 Tracking Setup

This Next.js static-export site loads Google Tag Manager from `public/js/global-88881.js`.

## Production Resources

- GTM account: `LT Automation 6346744109`
- GTM container name: `Metro Pinjaman Berlesen`
- GTM container ID: `GTM-PFSGCN88`
- GA4 account: `LT Automation 389036374`
- GA4 property name: `Metro Pinjaman Berlesen`
- GA4 property ID: `544621007`
- GA4 web stream ID: `15218086624`
- GA4 measurement ID: `G-2R37LT2QLR`

The production Doppler config `locus-t-ai-backend/prd` has been updated with:

- `GTM_CONTAINER_ID=GTM-PFSGCN88`
- `PUBLIC_GTM_CONTAINER_ID=GTM-PFSGCN88`
- `PUBLIC_GTM_ID=GTM-PFSGCN88`
- `GA4_PROPERTY_ID=544621007`
- `GA4_STREAM_ID=15218086624`
- `PUBLIC_GA4_MEASUREMENT_ID=G-2R37LT2QLR`
- `GTM_ACCOUNT_REFERENCE=LT Automation 6346744109`

GA4 property IDs are not measurement IDs. Only `G-2R37LT2QLR` should be used as the GA4 web measurement ID.

## Runtime Behavior

- GTM is loaded when a valid `GTM-*` ID is configured.
- Direct GA4 `gtag` loading is only used as a fallback when GTM is not configured.
- Events are pushed through `window.dataLayer` when GTM is active.
- The GTM container is published with GA4 bootstrap and event tags for the implemented custom events.
- No personal form fields are pushed to analytics.

## Implemented Events

- `whatsapp_click`: existing WhatsApp links and the contact phone card.
- `google_maps_click`: existing Google Maps link on the contact page.
- `waze_click`: existing Waze link on the contact page.
- `lead_form_submit`: fires only after the contact booking form receives a successful `/api/bookings` response.

## Skipped Events

- `facebook_click`: footer links are placeholders using `href="#"`.
- `instagram_click`: footer links are placeholders using `href="#"`.
- `linkedin_click`: footer links are placeholders using `href="#"`.
- `x_click`: no X/Twitter link exists.
- `tiktok_click`: no TikTok link exists.

The How To Apply form is visible but has no real submit handler or success state, so it is not tracked as a successful lead submission.
